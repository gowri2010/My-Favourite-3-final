<h1>My Hobby Is Playing Music</h1>
<p>My hobby is playing Music. Music came into my life when I was 5 years old. My Father bought me a keyboard and that was when Music became my hobby. Music is powerful and calming. It soothens your mind and keeps you at ease. People listen to Music when they are traveling, for fun, and also to go to sleep. Music is like a person you can express your emotions to, because Music is also filled with emotions. Nobody knows how many people listen to Music around the world, but I know for a fact that there are many. Millions of people post videos of songs they sang or made every single day. All of that is Music! One of the best things that have happened in my life is Music. My dream is to become a Musician once I grow up, and create all sorts of pieces of Music.

<h5>My inspiration is Music, and I have already typed a whole paragraph about it. So that is why I have only posted a few songs that I love in this section. For the Believer song I have put the video of the One Voice Childrens Choir, but it is not the official video. In the skating section and this section you cannot see the image of the videos, so what you have to do is right click on the little blue folded squares and select the "open image in new tab" option and click on the new tab, and then you will be able to watch the videos given.</h5>
